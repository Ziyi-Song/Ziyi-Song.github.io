### Topics on Bayesian asymptotics and Posterior Convergence

Much important work in this area has been done in past two decades, so it is not included in some monographs. Before appreciating papers, I find it helpful to read:
- [***Bayesian Nonparametrics***](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387955377), J.K.Ghosh and R.V.Ramamoorthi, Springer\
This book primarily emphasize on statistical theory, and the first four chapters serve as an elegant introduction to Dirichlet processes and issues arising in Bayesian asymptotics.
 
 This recent report gives a detail proof of the famous Doob's Theorem, in which measurability of some functions is very well-proved:
 - [***A detailed treatment of Doob's theorem***](https://jwmi.github.io/publications/Doobs_theorem.pdf), Jeffrey W. Miller, 2018
 
A comprehensive book:
- [***Fundamentals of Nonparametric Bayesian Inference***](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/fundamentals-of-nonparametric-bayesian-inference/C96325101025D308C9F31F4470DEA2E8), S.Ghosal and A. van der Vaart, Cambridge Series, 2017\
This book is difficult for learners, but deserves careful reading again and again.
 

### Topics on Dirichlet Process Prior

I started learning Bayesian Nonparametrics by reading literatures on Dirichlet Process. This topic was first introduced by Thomas Ferguson (1973) and then developed in the following decades and achieved at a great level as [Hierachical Dirichlet Processes](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/papers/hdp.pdf) around 2005. 

Here is a nice lecture note on Bayesian Nonparametrics, with an emphasis on the modeling and inference using Dirichlet process mixtures and their extensions, by [Prof. Long Nguyen](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~xuanlong/):
- [Lectures on Bayesian Nonparametrics: modeling, algorithms and some theory](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~xuanlong/Papers/dpm_viasm.pdf)

Here I think is a good chronological order to follow, so as to have a better feeling of Dirichlet Process:

- *Ferguson Distributions via Polya Urn Schemes*, D.Blackwell, J.B.MacQueen, 1973
- *Mixtures of Dirichlet Processes with Applications to Bayesian Nonparametric Problems*, C.E.Antoniak, 1974
- *On a Class of Bayesian Nonparametric Estimates: I.Density Estimates*, A.Y.Lo, 1984
- *Estimating Normal Means with a Dirichlet Process Prior*, M.D.Escobar, 1994
- *Hierarchical priors and mixture models, with applications in regression and density estimation*, M.West, P.Muller & M.D.Escobar, 1994

- *Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes*, Y.W.Teh, M.I.Jordan, M.J.Beal, D.Blei, 2006
- *The Nested Chinese Restaurant Process and Bayesian Nonparametric Inference of Topic Hierarchies*, D.Blei, T.Griffiths, M.I.Jordan, 2007
- *Distance Dependent Chinese Restaurant Processes*, D.Blei, P.I.Frazier, 2011
- *Nested Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes*, J.Paisley, C.Wang, D.Blei, M.I.Jordan, 2012
- *A Sticky HDP-HMM with Application to Speaker Diarization*, E.B.Fox, E.Sudderth, M.I.Jordan, A.S.Willsky, 2011


Some useful references for Inference and Simulation on Dirichlet Process:
- *Probabilistic Inference Using MCMC Methods*, R.M.Neal, 1993
- *Conjugate Bayesian analysis of the Gaussian distribution*, Kevin P. Murphy, 2007


I also wrote two reading reports on Dirichlet Process:
- [DP Mixture inference derivations: an example](Ziyi DPM_infer_deri_example.pdf)
- [Dirichlet Process Report](Ziyi Dirichlet Process Report.pdf)
