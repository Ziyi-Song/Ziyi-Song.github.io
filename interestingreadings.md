### Topics on Bayesian asymptotics and Posterior Convergence

Much important work in this area has been done in past two decades, so it is not included in some monographs. Before appreciating papers, I find it helpful to read:
- [***Bayesian Nonparametrics***](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387955377), J.K.Ghosh and R.V.Ramamoorthi, Springer\
This book primarily emphasize on statistical theory, and the first four chapters serve as an elegant introduction to Dirichlet processes and issues arising in Bayesian asymptotics.
 
 This recent report gives a detail proof of the famous Doob's Theorem, in which measurability of some functions is very well-proved:
 - [***A detailed treatment of Doob's theorem***](https://jwmi.github.io/publications/Doobs_theorem.pdf), Jeffrey W. Miller, 2018
 
A comprehensive book:
- [***Fundamentals of Nonparametric Bayesian Inference***](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/fundamentals-of-nonparametric-bayesian-inference/C96325101025D308C9F31F4470DEA2E8), S.Ghosal and A. van der Vaart, Cambridge Series, 2017\
This book is difficult for learners, but deserves careful reading again and again.
