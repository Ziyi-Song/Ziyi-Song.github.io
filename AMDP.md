<h1>AMDP Program</h1>

AMDP: Accelarated Master's Degree Program.

AMDP is cooperated between the Department of Statistcs, UMich and its collabarators, including my undergraduate institute, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK(SZ)).

I majored in Statistical Science at CUHK(SZ). I got admitted by this AMDP at the end of my third year study, so I came to study at Umich since my fourth year. The AMDP program is designed as two-year. Besides finishing enough credits to get a Master's Degree, I need to take extra courses within the first year, so as to fulfill the credit requirements for the Bachelor's Degree for my undergraduate University. 

Thus after one-year study at UMich, I graduated from CUHK(SZ) with B.S. in Statistical Science in May 2020, and I am expected to graduate form UMich with M.S. in Applied Statistics in May 2021.
