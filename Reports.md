## Reading reports on Dirichlet Process prior

We are familiar with finite Gaussian mixture model in Bayesian world. Routinely construct a generative model augmented with assignment variables and finite k different Gaussian distributions, give priors and observations, compute posterior distributions for all model parameters, directly estimate density, and evaluate predictive distributions.

In this report, we discuss these issues using data distributions derived as normal mixtures in the framework of Dirichlet processes. Besides dealing with above issues, as a natural by-product, we develop approaches to inference about the number of components and modes in a population distribution.

The important content and framework of this report was introduced by Escobar and West (1995). But detailed derivations and steps are skipped in their paper. Our report here provides you a whole story with every single derivation.

This report is comprised of what I think is most fundamental in Bayesian Nonparametric for novices. The report goes in a sequence of topics: Dirichlet Processes, Dirichlet Process Mixtures, Markov Chain Sampling for Dirichlet Process Mixture models, Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes, applications on autonomous multi-vehicle interaction sce- narios modeling.
