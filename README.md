## Welcome to My Blog

I am Ziyi Song(宋子毅), a second year [AMDP program](AMDP.md) student in the Department of Statistics, University of Michigan. 

I currently focus on some readings about **Consistency Theory** and **Contraction Rates** in the context of **Bayesian Nonparametrics (BNP)**. 

It is quite natural that a Bayesian concerns Bayesian inference methods for nonparametrc models, which construct prior distributions on infinite-dimensional spaces instead of putting too much mass on a small set. It avoids unverifiable assumptions in parametric models, and then inference is based on the posterior distribution. A lot challenges and difficulties arise in BNP, like piror construction, computation, asymptotic behavior, etc. For example, posterior consistency ensures that the posterior distribution eventually concentrates its mass at a point in arbitrarily small neighbirhood of the ture value of the parameter, so that the prior choice will not influence too much. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Ziyi-Song/ziyisong/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Ziyi-Song/ziyisong/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
