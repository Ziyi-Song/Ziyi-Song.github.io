## Welcome to My Blog

### About me
I am Ziyi Song(宋子毅), a second year [AMDP program](AMDP.md) student in the Department of Statistics, University of Michigan. 

I currently focus on some readings about **Consistency Theory** and **Contraction Rates** in the context of **Bayesian Nonparametrics (BNP)**. 

It is quite natural that a Bayesian concerns Bayesian inference methods for nonparametrc models, which construct prior distributions on infinite-dimensional spaces instead of putting too much mass on a small set. It avoids unverifiable assumptions in parametric models, and then inference is based on the posterior distribution. A lot challenges and difficulties arise in BNP, like piror construction, computation, asymptotic behavior, etc. 

For example, posterior consistency means that the posterior distribution eventually, in the weak sense, concentrates its mass at a point in arbitrarily small neighbirhood of the ture value of the parameter with observations increase infinitely, so that the prior choice will not influence too much. Doob's Theorem (1949) tells us that the posterior is consistent for all values of the parameter in the support of the prior. However, the asymptotic properties require much stronger conditions in infinite-dimensional cases. Freedman (1963) first proposed this issue with an infinite-cell multinomial example.

The topics I mention above is only a glimpse of BNP world. Although it cannot tell you the whole story, you still can taste a flavor of the beauty in modern statistics.  

### Some Math Prerequisites
BNP needs us to be very familiar with some graduate-level mathematics, especially probability theory and measure-based real analysis. I am also strengthening my math knowledge right now. I can share you some books I use and find really good.
- Point-Set Topology: 
  - *Topology*, James R. Munkres, 2nd Edition (2000) 
    - Reading Chapter 2-4 gives us good enough understandings on some topological notions used in analysis
- Real Analysis: 
  - *Real Analysis*, H.L.Royden & P.M.Fitzpatrick, 4th Edition
- Functional Analysis: 
  - *Lecture Notes on Functional Analysis*, Alberto Bressan; 
  - *Applied Analysis*, John K. Hunter & B. Nachtergaele
- Probability Theory: 
  - *A Probability Path*, Sidney I. Resnick
    - I personally think it is a great book for students first learning probability theory. This book is comprehensive and provides rigorous proofs in a understandable way. It is also the textbook for STATS 621 at UMich. 
  - *Probability: Theory and Examples*, Rick Durrett, 5th Edition
- To be continued

Mastering knowledge in the books I list here only helps you feel a bit more comfortable while reading materials in Bayesian Nonparametrics. It doesn't mean that you will easily understand BNP with these math tools. These math are necessary but far from sufficient. BNP is appealing and difficult :joy: KEEP LEARNING
