## Reading manuscripts on EM Convergence Rate

**[EM Convergence Rate](EM Convergence Rate.pdf)**\
Ziyi Song, Oct 2020, Ann Arbor, MI

This manuscript introduces Theorem 1 & Theorem 2 in paper [R. Dwivedi, N. Ho & K. Khamaru (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00828).




## Reading reports on Dirichlet Process prior

**[DP Mixture inference derivations: an example](Ziyi DPM_infer_deri_example.pdf)**\
Ziyi Song, June 2020, Ann Arbor, MI

In this report, we discuss issues in Gaussian mixture model using data distributions derived as normal mixtures in the framework of Dirichlet processes. Besides dealing with these issues, as a natural by-product, we develop approaches to inference about the number of components and modes in a population distribution. This report follows Escobar and West (1995).


**[Dirichlet Process Report](Ziyi Dirichlet Process Report.pdf)**\
Ziyi Song, May 2020, Ann Arbor, MI
               
This report is comprised of what I think is most fundamental in Bayesian Nonparametric for novices. The report goes in a sequence of topics: Dirichlet Processes, Dirichlet Process Mixtures, Markov Chain Sampling for Dirichlet Process Mixture models, Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes, applications on autonomous multi-vehicle interaction sce- narios modeling.
