## Reading reports 

**[Dirichlet Process Report](Ziyi Dirichlet Process Report.pdf)**\
Ziyi Song, May 2020, Ann Arbor
               
This report is comprised of what I think is most fundamental in Bayesian Nonparametric for novices. The report goes in a sequence of topics: Dirichlet Processes, Dirichlet Process Mixtures, Markov Chain Sampling for Dirichlet Process Mixture models, Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes, applications on autonomous multi-vehicle interaction sce- narios modeling.
